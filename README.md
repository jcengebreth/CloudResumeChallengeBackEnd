# Cloud Resume Challenge Back End

This is my repository for the cloud resume challenge. The respository includes:

- visitor_count - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- tests - Unit tests for the application code. 
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.
- .github/workflows - YAML files for defining GitHub Actions.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions and an API Gateway API. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.
