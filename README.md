# Cloud Resume Challenge Back End

This is my repository for the cloud resume challenge. The respository includes:

- visitor_count - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- tests - Unit tests for the application code. 
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.
- .github/workflows - YAML files for defining GitHub Actions.

The application uses several AWS resources, including an S3 bucket, CloudFront, Route53, ACM, Lambda function, DynamoDB table, and an API Gateway REST API.
